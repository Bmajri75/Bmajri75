### 👋 About Me
- 😊 In the past, I have developed skills and knowledge in various fields.
- ⭐ I am **diligent**, **curious**, **punctual**, and **autonomous**—qualities that have always defined me.
- 💻 Passionate about technology, I have learned to code as a self-taught developer.
- 🏊‍♂️ I participated in several intensive coding programs, such as the EPITECH WebAcademy and 42, which I had to leave due to the COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020. I undertook these challenges purely for the love of learning.
- 📚 I constantly stay up-to-date with tech trends, participate in online MeetUps, and actively contribute new ideas.
- 👨‍💻 I am open to both **CDD** and **CDI** contracts, as well as freelance projects. I hold an auto-entrepreneur status, so I can help you with your web application projects or other IT needs.
